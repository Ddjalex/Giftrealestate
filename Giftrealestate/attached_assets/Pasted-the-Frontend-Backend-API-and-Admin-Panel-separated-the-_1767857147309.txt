the Frontend, Backend (API), and Admin Panel separated, the best way to describe this is through a Service-Oriented Architecture or a Headless approach using Core PHP.

1. The Architecture
To keep things truly separate on Replit, you should organize your project into three distinct directories or separate Replit deployments:

Frontend (User-Facing): This is the public website where users browse properties. It should be built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap/Tailwind), and JavaScript. It communicates with the Backend via AJAX/Fetch requests.

Backend (Core Logic & API): This is a "Headless" PHP application. It manages the MySQL database, processes logic, and serves data as JSON. No HTML is rendered here.

Admin Panel: A restricted dashboard for the site owner. It has its own UI but talks to the same Backend API to add, edit, or delete listings.

2. Functional Modules (Based on Ethiopia Real Estate Standards)
To match the reference site, your application should include:

Property Management: Support for different types (Apartments, Villas, Commercial), status (For Sale, Rent, Reduced Price), and location-specific tags (e.g., CMC, Bole, Ayat).

Search & Filtering: A robust system to filter by price range, bedroom count, area (sq ft), and specific amenities (WiFi, Elevator, Parking).

User/Agent Roles: Separate login flows for regular users (to save favorites) and agents (to list properties).

Lead System: A contact form on each property page that sends inquiries directly to the Admin.

3. Technical Roadmap for Replit
A. Backend (PHP API)
Database (MySQL): Use Replit’s built-in database or a db.sql file. Tables needed: users, properties, images, inquiries.

Routing: Create a router.php to handle requests like /api/properties or /api/login.

Security: Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authenticating the Admin Panel and User accounts without sessions.

B. Frontend (Consumer)
Dynamic Loading: Use fetch() in JavaScript to get data from your Backend PHP scripts.

UI Components: Use a Grid Layout for property cards and a "Half Map" view for location-based searches.

C. Admin Panel (Management)
Dashboard: Statistics on property views and inquiries.

CRUD Operations: A dedicated interface to upload property images (handling PHP file uploads to an uploads/ folder) and manage listing details.
