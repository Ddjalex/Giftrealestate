"I need to optimize my website https://realestatepropertyaddis.com/ for search engines. Please perform the following:

Dynamic Sitemap: Create a script to generate a sitemap.xml file that includes my homepage, the new Legehar blog post, and all property listing pages.

SEO Meta Tags: Update the <head> section of the homepage and blog pages with these specific tags:

Title: Real Estate Property Addis | Gift Real Estate Legehar Apartments

Description: Find luxury apartments and commercial shops for sale in Addis Ababa. Explore the Gift Real Estate Legehar project with exclusive 20% discounts.

Robots.txt: Add a robots.txt file that points to the sitemap at https://realestatepropertyaddis.com/sitemap.xml.

Schema Markup: Add 'RealEstateListing' and 'Organization' schema (JSON-LD) to help Google display my price lists and phone numbers directly in search results."

2. Top SEO Keywords for Your Domain
Because your domain name contains "Real Estate Property Addis," you should focus on these keywords to "match" your URL. Include these in your blog titles and image alt-texts:

Top Priority: "Real Estate Property Addis Ababa" (This matches your domain perfectly).

High Traffic: "Gift Real Estate Legehar price list 2026".

Targeted: "Apartments for sale in Legehar Village".

Amharic/English Mix: "ጊፍት ሪል ስቴት (Gift Real Estate) house prices".

3. Why your site isn't showing "at the top" yet
Looking at your screenshots, Google is currently showing Google Business Profiles (Maps) and Social Media (Telegram/Facebook) for Gift Real Estate. To beat these and get your website to the #1 spot:

Submit to Search Console: Go to Google Search Console, add https://realestatepropertyaddis.com/, and paste your sitemap link there. Without this, Google may not find your site until summer is over.

Internal Linking: In your new blog post, make sure you have a link that says "View more Real Estate Property in Addis" that points back to your homepage.

Backlinks: Share your website link (realestatepropertyaddis.com) on the Telegram channel shown in your screenshots (t.me/rsgift). When Google sees a busy Telegram channel linking to your new website, it will move your site to the top much faster.

Summary of your Summer Goal:
If you upload the Sitemap this week and post 2 blogs per month using the keywords above, Google will recognize your site as the "official" source for property info in Addis by the time summer arrives.
